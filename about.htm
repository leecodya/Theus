			<h4><b>History</b></h4>
			<hr>
			<p>In the beginning, Terry Theus started working as a recovery pastor for those in need and part-time motivational speaker. Through past experiences, he slowly started earning a name for himself as a local contractor for Lowe's and Lumber Liquidator's. For 15 years, he would be the go-to guy that these businesses would call if they had a client that just bought flooring and needed a quality installation. He has been serving the middle Georgia area for over 25 years and has built rapport and credibility with hundreds of people in need of floor installation, such as the mayor of Warner Robins Randy Toms.</p><br>
